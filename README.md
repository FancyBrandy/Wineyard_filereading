Spring is coming in vineyard called "Fine Wine Good Health". As you know grape likes care, work but much more busy workers which
is grated by an excellent produce. The vineyard needs a lot of workers therefore we have to implement an application for it.

The vineyard waits for the registration of those who can enter employment in the spring period. During the registration they have to give some personal data: 
their names, addresses and the weekdays when they can work. (Give the days separated by spaces e.g. Monday Wendsday Friday!) 
The vineyard knows how many workers they need on given days. (e.g. Monday 12 Thuesday 18 etc.) If there is enough worker for a given day the application has to reject 
further applicants for that day. 

The data of the applicants are stored in file. The program is able to modify, to delete the data and make a daily and full list of them. 

Note: the file has to be run in Linux system.
